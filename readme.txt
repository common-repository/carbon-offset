Carbon Offset allows you to offset the CO2 emissions of your website, helping us build a better and more sustainable future for the web.

== Description ==

With the web's energy consumption surpassing that of global air travel, it is of paramount importance to build a more sustainable web. Carbon Offset allows you to offset the CO2 emissions of your website, integrating with the Cloverly API. 

Version 1.0 calculates the greenhouse emissions from your website visits and integrates with the [Cloverly](https://cloverly.com) for offsets & payments.
The plugin is easily extendable to add future implementations of other services capable of carbon offsets on demand, as well as transaction-based carbon-offsetting for e-commerce (not yet implemented in v1.0).

== Installation ==

Upload the Carbon-Offset plugin to your blog, activate it, and then visit its admin page for your settings.
